# Project Explanation: Real-Time Logistics Performance Overview

For this project, I obtained the dataset from [Kaggle: Logistics and Supply Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasetengineer/logistics-and-supply-chain-dataset/data). I performed data cleaning using Python and Pandas to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. The goal of this project was to create a dashboard that presents real-time logistics performance, focusing on several key metrics related to delivery, fuel consumption, and warehouse inventory management. The visualizations I created aim to provide a clear and structured overview of various factors impacting logistics operations, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## 1. Delivery Time and Delays

This dashboard provides an overview of the delivery time deviation, which measures how fast or slow deliveries are compared to the established targets. The percentage of late deliveries is also shown, helping to identify whether the delivery process is running as expected or needs improvement.

## 2. Impact of Traffic Congestion on Deliveries

Traffic congestion is one of the external factors that can affect delivery time. By displaying traffic data across different months, this visualization helps to understand when and how congestion impacts delivery speed and how it can be anticipated.

## 3. Fuel Consumption and Its Impact on Efficiency

This section shows how fuel consumption varies throughout the day based on traffic congestion levels. This provides insights into the fuel efficiency used during the delivery process, which directly affects operational costs.

## 4. Risk Classification in Deliveries

Delivery performance is also affected by risk factors such as weather conditions, chosen routes, or other operational issues. This dashboard classifies deliveries based on their risk levels, giving an overview of which deliveries are more susceptible to delays and other issues.

## 5. Vehicle Location and Risk

By displaying vehicle GPS locations based on risk classification, this visualization allows us to see if there are any distribution patterns related to high or low-risk vehicles. This can be used to optimize routes or better manage the fleet of vehicles.

## 6. Warehouse Inventory Management

This dashboard also provides information on warehouse inventory levels by day of the week. Knowing which days have higher inventory levels helps in planning stock management and logistics, minimizing the possibility of shortages or overstocking.

## Conclusion

Through this dashboard, I combine various metrics and data to provide clearer insights into overall logistics performance. It allows companies to identify areas that need more attention and enables them to take more informed actions to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer service.
