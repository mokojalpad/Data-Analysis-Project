# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview

This repository contains SQL-based data analysis projects, which are part of my learning from the **Data Analysis and SQL** course by the University of California, Davis, on Coursera. The projects analyze agricultural production data, including commodities like milk, cheese, honey, coffee, yogurt, and eggs.
