# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to another one of my projects. In this repository, I will take a deeper dive into data analysis. I will showcase my work using SQL, Python, MS Excel, and Power BI. Each project will focus on applying different data analysis techniques and tools to solve real-world problems and derive insights from datasets.

## Project Files

### 1. [P1 - Final Project from SQL for Data Science](https://github.com/mokojalpad/Data-Analysis-Project/tree/main/P1%20-%20Final%20Project%20from%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science)

This project contains SQL-based data analysis projects, which are part of my learning from the **Data Analysis and SQL** course by the [University of California, Davis, on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science). The projects analyze agricultural production data, including commodities like milk, cheese, honey, coffee, yogurt, and eggs.

- **`create table.sql`**: Script to create the required tables.
- **`Task 1.sql`**: SQL queries for various analysis tasks.
- **`Task 2.sql`**: Additional queries for cross-commodity and missing data reports.
