# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to another one of my projects. In this repository, I will take a deeper dive into data analysis. I will showcase my work using SQL, Python, MS Excel, and Power BI. Each project will focus on applying different data analysis techniques and tools to solve real-world problems and derive insights from datasets.

## Project Files

### 1. [P1 - Final Project from SQL for Data Science](https://github.com/mokojalpad/Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/P1%20-%20Final%20Project%20from%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science/Task%201.sql)

This project contains SQL-based data analysis projects, which are part of my learning from the **Data Analysis and SQL** course by the [University of California, Davis, on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science). The projects analyze agricultural production data, including commodities like milk, cheese, honey, coffee, yogurt, and eggs.

- **`create table.sql`**: Script to create the required tables.
- **`Task 1.sql`**: SQL queries for various analysis tasks.
- **`Task 2.sql`**: Additional queries for cross-commodity and missing data reports.

### 2. [P2 - Logistics and Supply Chain](https://github.com/mokojalpad/Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/P2%20-%20Logistics%20and%20Supply%20Chain/Cleaning%20Data%20Logistic.ipynb) (Not Done Yet ðŸ™‚)

For this project, I used **Python** for data cleaning on the **logistics and supply chain dataset** (source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasetengineer/logistics-and-supply-chain-dataset/data)) and **Power BI** to create interactive visualizations. The visualizations cover metrics such as fuel consumption, delivery time deviation, traffic congestion levels, and warehouse inventory levels, which help analyze operational efficiency and risk management within the supply chain.

- **`!Explanation, Insight & Conclusion.md`**: This markdown file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the explanation of the data files, the insights derived from the analysis, and the final conclusions drawn from the logistics data. It summarizes the methodology, highlights key findings, and offers actionable recommendations based on the visualizations and cleaned data.
- **`Cleaning Data Logistic.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python-based data cleaning process, utilizing the pandas library to preprocess and organize the raw data for further analysis.
- **`dynamic_supply_chain_logistics_dataset.csv`**: This is the raw dataset, containing unprocessed data that has yet to undergo any cleaning or transformation.
- **`Logistics Visual.pbix`**: This is the Power BI file containing the visualizations that provide insights into the supply chain and logistics data, including metrics like fuel consumption, delivery delays, and inventory levels.
- **`supply_chain_logistics_cleaned.csv`**: This is the final cleaned dataset after processing, ready for analysis and visualization.
